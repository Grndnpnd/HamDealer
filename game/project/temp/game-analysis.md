# HAM DEALER Game Analysis

## Current Game Structure Analysis

Based on the task description, HAM DEALER is a browser-based, retro-styled, single-player, turn-based economy simulation game. The game appears to involve buying and selling different types of ham, managing debt with a deadline system, and traveling between locations with random events.

### Identified Issues from Task Description

1. **Display Issues**: Not all ham types are being displayed with buy/sell options
2. **UI Sizing Problems**: Text and button sizes need adjustment to fit correctly
3. **Missing Feature**: 30-day debt deadline feature needs to be implemented
4. **Missing Feature**: Pop-up system for random events during travel needs to be added

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Ensuring All Ham Types Are Displayed with Buy/Sell Options

**Analysis**: The game appears to have a bug where not all ham types are being displayed with buy/sell options. This could be due to:
- Incomplete rendering of ham type elements in the UI
- Logic issues in the market.js file that filters or limits displayed ham types
- Data structure issues where some ham types are not properly defined or accessible

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Review the market.js file to understand how ham types are defined and displayed
2. Identify the code responsible for rendering ham types in the UI
3. Fix any conditional logic that might be preventing certain ham types from displaying
4. Ensure all ham types have proper buy/sell button associations
5. Test the market interface with all ham types to verify they display correctly

### 2. Adjusting Text and Button Sizes

**Analysis**: There appear to be UI sizing issues where text and buttons don't fit correctly.

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Review the style.css file to identify current text and button size definitions
2. Adjust CSS properties for text elements (font-size, line-height, etc.)
3. Modify button dimensions and padding to ensure proper sizing
4. Implement responsive design principles to ensure UI elements adapt to different screen sizes
5. Test the UI on multiple screen sizes to verify proper text and button rendering

### 3. Implementing 30-Day Debt Deadline Feature

**Analysis**: The game needs a 30-day debt deadline feature, which suggests:
- The game has a time/day progression system
- There's a debt mechanic that needs a time limit
- Consequences for not paying debt by the deadline need to be implemented

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Review game.js to understand the current day tracking mechanism
2. Implement or modify debt tracking system to include a deadline property
3. Add logic to check debt status against the 30-day deadline
4. Create UI elements to display debt deadline information to the player
5. Implement consequences for failing to meet the debt deadline (game over, penalties, etc.)
6. Add notifications as the deadline approaches to warn the player

### 4. Adding Pop-up System for Random Events During Travel

**Analysis**: The game needs a pop-up system for random events that occur during travel.

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Review travel.js to understand the current travel mechanics
2. Design a pop-up component that can display event information and choices
3. Create a library of random events with different outcomes
4. Implement logic to trigger random events during travel with appropriate probability
5. Connect event outcomes to game state changes (money, inventory, etc.)
6. Add visual and audio feedback for event pop-ups
7. Ensure pop-ups are dismissible and don't break the game flow

## Next Steps

1. Create basic HTML structure for the game interface
2. Implement core CSS styling maintaining the retro aesthetic
3. Develop the JavaScript modules according to the project structure
4. Implement the fixes for the identified issues
5. Test the game thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected

This analysis will be updated as development progresses and more information becomes available about the specific implementation details of the HAM DEALER game.

## Character Implementation
- The character is currently implemented as a circular avatar image in the player info section
- The avatar is displayed using an img tag with the source "assets/images/avatar.png"
- The avatar container has the following CSS properties:
  - Width and height: 80px
  - Border: 3px solid var(--accent-color) (yellow)
  - Border-radius: 50% (making it circular)
- The image is set to cover the container with object-fit: cover

## Current Color Scheme
- Primary color: #4a4a4a (dark gray) - Used for headers, buttons
- Secondary color: #8a8a8a (medium gray) - Used for player info background
- Accent color: #f7d51d (yellow) - Used for highlights, borders, hover effects
- Background color: #f0f0f0 (light gray) - Used for page background
- Text color: #333333 (near black) - Used for main text
- Border color: #666666 (gray) - Used for borders
- Success color: #28a745 (green) - Used for buy buttons
- Danger color: #dc3545 (red) - Used for sell buttons

## Asset Loading Mechanism
- Assets are loaded directly via HTML for the avatar image
- No preloading system or loading screen is currently implemented
- JavaScript files are loaded at the end of the HTML body
- The game initializes when the DOM is loaded using the DOMContentLoaded event listener

## Observations for Implementing Required Changes

### Character Update
- Need to replace the current avatar.png with the new bakrbot.png design
- May need to adjust the avatar container size to accommodate a larger character
- Should maintain the circular framing but potentially increase its size

### Retro Arcade Color Scheme
- Current color scheme is somewhat muted and could be enhanced with more vibrant retro arcade colors
- Consider using brighter neon colors typical of retro arcade games
- Potential colors to include: bright blue, neon pink, electric green, and vibrant purple

### Background Music
- No audio elements or background music currently exist
- Need to add an audio element to the HTML
- Should implement volume control and autoplay with low volume
- Will need to source appropriate retro-style background music

### Loading Screen
- No loading screen is currently implemented
- Need to create a loading screen that appears when the game launches
- Should display while assets are loading
- Can use CSS animations for a retro-style loading effect

### Game Functionality Preservation
- All current game functionality must be maintained
- Need to ensure that any visual or audio changes don't interfere with the game mechanics
- Should test all features after implementing changes
